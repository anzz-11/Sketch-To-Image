🖌️ AI Sketch-to-Image Generator

An AI-powered desktop application that transforms hand-drawn sketches into high-quality realistic or stylized images using Generative AI and diffusion models.

📌 Overview

This project implements a sketch-to-image generation system using Stable Diffusion and ControlNet. Users can draw simple sketches on a canvas and generate detailed images in multiple styles (Realistic, Animated, Outline).

The system runs locally and integrates a web-based frontend with a FastAPI backend powered by deep learning models.

🚀 Features

🎨 Interactive drawing canvas

✏️ Brush and eraser tools

🎭 Multiple style modes (Realistic, Animated, Outline)

⚡ Diffusion-based image generation

🧠 Vision-based prompt generation

💻 Fully local processing (no cloud dependency)

🔁 Multiple generation cycles with reset support

🏗️ System Architecture

result.html

🔄 First-Time Run

On first execution, required AI models will be downloaded automatically and cached locally. This may take several minutes.

🧪 Usage

Draw a sketch on the canvas.

Select a style (Realistic / Animated / Outline).

Click Generate.

View the generated image on the Result page.

Click Clear to reset and draw again.

📊 Performance Notes

GPU acceleration significantly improves generation speed.

Inference time depends on hardware configuration.

RTX 20xx and above GPUs are recommended.

⚠️ Limitations

Requires high hardware resources.

Limited style customization.

Single image generation per request.

🔮 Future Enhancements

High-resolution model integration

Depth-based control

Mobile application support

Real-time optimization
